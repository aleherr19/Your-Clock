This document specifies what milestones to reach before an MVP can be produced

- Entirely written with Javascript & JQuery
- Uses dynamic styling to change color scheme
- Day and Night mode colors by default
- Simple clock widget and/or weather widget
- Fullsceen mode by button click
- Dynamic for any screen size with its fluid design



Stage 1:
- Set up required project folder/files
- Include required libraries and test to make sure they work
- Make baseline HTML template with outlined boxes (No css yet really)
- Implement a clock into the webpage using Javscript (Format should be HH:mm or HH:mm:ss for seconds too)
- Create two extra color themes in css with a day/night mode

Stage 2:
- Create a slide-out UI that allows you to select different
  color themes and switch up to day or night mode. 
- Throw in a (developer plus) custom color theme (maybe like a dark mint color?)
