# Your Clock
A (somewhat) cuztomizable clock built on Javascript and JQuery.

Go fullscreen mode and have a full-display clock. Choose from a light day theme or dark night theme, or select auto to mimic the system theme color.
Standard or military time is selectable, along with a horizontal or verticle clock face. With everything being processed locally in Javascript, enjoy
the clean UI with smooth animations backed up by JQuery.
